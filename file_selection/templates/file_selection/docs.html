        <p class="doc-line">
            Markup is an online annotation tool that can be used to transform unstructured documents into structured <a href="http://brat.nlplab.org/standoff.html" target="_blank">standoff format</a> for NLP and ML tasks, such as named-entity recognition. Markup learns as you annotate in order to predict and suggest complex annotations. Markup also provides integrated access to existing and custom ontologies, enabling the prediction and suggestion of ontology mappings based on the text you're annotating.

            Annotation
        </h2>
        <p class="doc-line">
            To add an annotation, you must:
            
            <ul class="doc-line doc-list">
                <li>Highlight the desired span of text within the open document.</li>
                <li>Select a desired entity.</li>
                <li>Populate or select a value from the available attributes, which have been dynamically displayed based on the selected entity, as desired.</li>
                <li>Select an ontology term to map to. Markup automatically suggests ontology mappings based on the text you're annotating, although a direct search of the ontology can be performed via Markup if necessary.</li>
                <li>Add the annotation by pressing the <span class="doc-field">+ Annotation</span> button</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="doc-line">
            Upon adding an annotation, it will displayed both within the document text and on the annotation panel. Within the annotation panel, annotations will be grouped by their entity, and ordered based on the appearance within the document text.
        </p>
        <p class="doc-line">
            Hovering over an annotation in either the document panel or annotation panel will highlight the annotation in both panels, and will display a tooltip containing information about the annotation (e.g. attributes).
        </p>
        <p class="doc-line">
            Clicking an annotation within the annotation panel will display a dropdown that contains all information (e.g. attributes) that correspond with the annotation, along with options for editing and deleting the annotation. 
        </p>
        <p class="doc-line">
            Markup allows for unlimited annotation of a single region, thus enabling the capture of complex data.

        <h2 class="doc-headline">
            Annotation Suggestions
        </h2>
        <ul class="doc-line">
            <li>Markup will indicate any annotation suggestions above where then annotations appear on the right-hand side (it may take a few seconds for the suggestions to appear, depending on the specification of your machine).
            <li>These annotations will be grouped by entity and coloured according to the entities on the left-hand side.
            <li>Clicking on a suggested annotation will give the user the opportunity to review the suggestion before accepting or rejecting it, where:
            <ul class="doc-line">
                <li>Accepting will add the annotation, along with its appropriate entity and attributes.</li>
                <li>Rejecting will feedback into the prediction model to improve future annotations.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The ability to edit the suggestions will be added soon.
            <li>Upon adding the annotation, the annotation will span the whole sentence where the appropriate sequence is found.
            Exporting Annotations
            <li>After all the annotations have been added. Clicking on the Export button (next to + Annotation) will tell your browser to save the .ann file. It will usually save automatically to your download folder, however, it is possible, within the setting of some browsers, to select where this .ann file will be saved. Guidelines demonstrating the process for updating this setting is demonstrated on Chrome and Firefox <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/231002/how-to-change-the-chrome-download-folder-location/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/260271/how-to-change-the-firefox-download-folder-location/" target="_blank">here</a>, respectively.
        </ul>

        <h2 class="doc-headline">
            Configuration File
        </h2>
        <ul class="doc-line">
            <li>The annotation configuration file must be in the format of the annotation type configuration used by <a href="http://brat.nlplab.org/configuration.html" target="_blank">brat annotation configuration</a> however, it does not include the relations or event definitions. We do not yet support advanced entity level configuration, but advanced attribute configuration is included.</li>
            <li>Keyboard shortcut configuration is a feature that is soon to be added.</li>
            <li>We suggest using the built-in Configuration Creator if you have no experience creating an annotation configuration file.</li>
            <ul class="doc-line">
                <li>Add each of the entities you wish to annotate, one by one, into the Entities â€“ Entity name bar. Selecting + ENTITY after each one.</li>
                <li>Then you need to add the attributes to each Entity.</li>
                <li>In the attributes section, add the attribute name, the entity to go with that attribute, followed by any values you wish that attribute to have. For multiple values, separate each with a comma. Add the attribute by pressing +Attribute. The attribute will be shown on the page, with the entity and its values. Clicking on the attribute will remove it.</li>
                <li>Repeat the process until you have added each of your desired attributes. The attributes are added in the order they are created, we suggest adding all the attributes for one entity, then moving on to the next.</li>
                <li>Finally save the annotation configuration file to your system, with the save button.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The saved .conf file can be edited in any text editor.</li>
            <li>To add a new entity, simply add it the entities section of the conf file, anywhere above the â€˜[attributes]â€™ line. Then add the attributes, following the format as the already populated section.  With each value separated by a vertical bar (â€˜|â€™).</li>
