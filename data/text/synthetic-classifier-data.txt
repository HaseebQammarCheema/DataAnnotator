dear dr	0
i reviewed this 42 year old lady with epilepsy, together with her husband, in clinic today	0
she tells me that she has been getting episodes around twice a week of an unusual thought	0
this was difficult to describe but it was like an overfamiliar or deja vu feeling	0
these thoughts last for around 30 seconds	0
i think these are in keeping with temporal lobe onset focal seizures	0
this is interesting as previously she was getting events with coloured objects in her field of vision which were probably occipital lobe seizures	0
currently she is taking sodium valproate 500 mg twice a day and levetiracetam 1000 mg twice today	1
she has previously tried carbamazepine but this give her a rash	0
i explained the new mhra rules on prescribing sodium valproate in women of child bearing age	0
even though mrs williams has no plans for further children, rules stated that we should try an alternative medication given that she does not want to use a secure form of contraception	0
we had a discussion about the various risks and benefits of stopping sodium valproate	0
she should slowly reduce the sodium valproate by 200 mg every week	0
at the same time, she should introduce lamotrigine at 25 mg every day, increasing by 25 mg every fortnight, to a target dose of 75 mg twice a day	1
we also had a discussion about sudden death in epilepy (sudep)	0
overall this is rare, it is if real risk with people all continue to get seizures	0
we discussed things that can reduce the risk of sudep	0
these include not forgetting medication and controlling seizures	0
i will reveal mrs williams again in four months time	0
