Diagnosis:   Right sided temporal lobe epilepsy 

Medication:     Lacosamide 100mg morning, 125mg evening.
                Zonisamide 175 mg twice daily 
                            
I reviewed John in the paediatric neurology clinic today. I was pleased to hear that he has been a year seizure free.  He is currently looking for a job.

John reports that he sleeps well and sometimes has difficulty in getting up, but there are no nocturnal seizures noted by his mother and his sleep otherwise appears uneventful.  He tolerates his medication well with good adherence to the plan.  

He denies any current mood problems and seemed happier in himself.  

Since John was last seen he has been reviewed by Dr Jones in the epilepsy surgery programme. His brain imaging so far has been normal.  He is awaiting a further appointment with Dr Jones regarding further assessment for epilepsy surgery.

At this time as he has already appointed to the adult epilepsy surgery service and I have not made plans to see him again in the paediatric epilepsy clinic.  He is waiting an appointment with Dr Williams in the transitional team and I will write to Dr Williams to ensure that he is on the list
